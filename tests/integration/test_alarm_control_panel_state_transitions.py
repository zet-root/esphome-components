    This comprehensive test verifies all state transitions and listener callbacks:

    1. Basic arm/disarm sequences:
       - DISARMED -> ARMING -> ARMED_AWAY -> DISARMED
       - DISARMED -> ARMING -> ARMED_HOME -> DISARMED
       - DISARMED -> ARMING -> ARMED_NIGHT -> DISARMED

    2. Wrong code rejection

    3. Sensor triggering while armed:
       - ARMED_AWAY -> PENDING -> TRIGGERED (delayed sensor)
       - TRIGGERED -> ARMED_AWAY (auto-reset after trigger_time, fires on_cleared)

    4. Chime functionality:
       - Sensor open while DISARMED triggers on_chime

    5. Ready state:
       - Sensor state changes trigger on_ready
