"""Determine which CI jobs should run based on changed files.

This script is a centralized way to determine which CI jobs need to run based on
what files have changed. It outputs JSON with the following structure:

{
  "integration_tests": true/false,
  "clang_tidy": true/false,
  "clang_format": true/false,
  "python_linters": true/false,
  "changed_components": ["component1", "component2", ...],
  "component_test_count": 5,
  "memory_impact": {
    "should_run": "true/false",
    "components": ["component1", "component2", ...],
    "platform": "esp32-idf",
    "use_merged_config": "true"
  }
}

The CI workflow uses this information to:
- Skip or run integration tests
- Skip or run clang-tidy (and whether to do a full scan)
- Skip or run clang-format
- Skip or run Python linters (ruff, flake8, pylint, pyupgrade)
- Determine which components to test individually
- Decide how to split component tests (if there are many)
- Run memory impact analysis whenever there are changed components (merged config), and also for core-only changes

Usage:
  python script/determine-jobs.py [-b BRANCH]

Options:
  -b, --branch BRANCH  Branch to compare against (default: dev)

    1. Core C++ files changed (esphome/core/*)
       - Any .cpp, .h, .tcc files in the core directory

       - NOT included: esphome/*.py, esphome/dashboard/*.py, esphome/components/*/*.py

       - Any file in tests/integration/ directory

       - Examples: tests/integration/test_api.py, tests/integration/fixtures/api.yaml

    4. Components used by integration tests (or their dependencies) changed
       - The function parses all YAML files in tests/integration/fixtures/
       - Extracts which components are used in integration tests
       - Recursively finds all dependencies of those components
       - If any of these components have changes, tests must run
